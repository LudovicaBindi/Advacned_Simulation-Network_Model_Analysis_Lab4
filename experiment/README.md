## Introduction

This directory contains the output data generated by the model under different scenario settings.
There are two types of data generated:
1. Travel Time
2. Waiting Time


### 1. Travel Time

For each truck, travel time and total waiting time is recorded as a csv.

## Format

|             Column | Description                                                             |
|-------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|           Truck id | Unique ID of the truck                                                  |
|        Travel time | Time elapsed between the creation at the source and arrival at the sink |
| Total waiting time | Accumulated time delay                                                  |

### 2. Waiting Time

Whenever a truck arrives at a broken bridge and is faced with a delay, DataContainer
records this event. Results are saved as a csv.

## Format

|       Column | Description                                       |
|-------------:|:--------------------------------------------------|
|     Truck id | Unique ID of the truck                            |
|    Bridge id | Unique ID of the bridge                           |
| Waiting time | Delay time experienced by the truck at the bridge |

## Naming Convention

The way the files are named are scenario_[nameofscenario]_[bridge_break_min][slope]_replication...
For example: scenario_BCSscore_10.05_replication_0_travel_time.csv etc.
